You are tasked with developing a lightweight document rendering system for a text editor.
In the system, documents contain thousands of characters.
Each character type (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c') appears many times.
To improve performance and memory efficiency, identical characters must be shared.
 Each character shares its intrinsic data (the symbol itself), but has extrinsic data like font, position (x, y),
 and size that vary per usage.
 Implement this system using an abstract class as the Flyweight, and a factory to manage character sharing.
